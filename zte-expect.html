    Logging into a ZTE H158N with the help of expect

    Jalal Sela already took the time to break into a sibling of this router on his
    blog[1]. Having shell access to my router turned out to be more handy than I
    had anticipated.

    Of course you can have dropbear on it, but I've yet to dare edit `rcS` on it
    (although I suppose it gets overwritten on reboot anyway).

        #!/usr/bin/expect -f

        spawn telnet <a href="telnet://192.168.2.254:23">192.168.2.254 23</a>

        expect Username: { send "root\r" }
        expect Password: { send "public\r" }

        expect &gt;         { send "enable\r" }
        expect Password: { send "zte\r" }

        expect "#"       { send "shell\r" }
        expect Login:    { send "root\r" }
        expect Password: { send "root\r" }

        interact
