<h1><a name="section_1">Logging into a ZTE H158N with the help of expect</a></h1>

<p>Jalal Sela already took the time to break into a sibling of this router on his <a href="https://jalalsela.wordpress.com/2014/10/31/hacking-zte-router-zxhn-h108n/">blog</a>. Having shell access to my router turned out to be more handy than I had anticipated.
</p>
<p>Of course you can have dropbear on it, but I've yet to dare edit `rcS` on it
(although I suppose it gets overwritten on reboot anyway).
