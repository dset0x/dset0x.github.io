    Monitoring memory usage for weechat script leaks

    I was recently dealing with a memory leak within a script in `weechat`. I
    needed a quick and dirty way of figuring out which script was causing the
    trouble.

    Of course it makes no sense to use `awk` for this, but what the heck. This
    script unloads all weechat scripts, then loads them one at a time whenever
    passed a line.

        #!/usr/bin/env awk -f

        function load(scr) {
            print strftime("%s"), scr
            system("echo -e \*/script load "scr" &gt; ~/.weechat/weechat\_fifo_$(pgrep --exact weechat)")
        }

        function unload(scr) {
            system("echo -e \*/script unload "scr" &gt; ~/.weechat/weechat\_fifo_$(pgrep --exact weechat)")
        }

        BEGIN {
            "echo ~/.weechat/**/autoload/*" | getline script_paths_str
            split(script_paths_str, script_paths, " ")
            for(idx in script_paths) {
                len = split(script_paths[idx], _, "/")
                script_names[idx] = _[len]
                unload(script_names[idx])
            }
        }

        // {
            if(NR&gt;=1) {
                if(cur_script != "") {
                        unload(cur_script)
                }

                cur_script = script_names[NR+1]
                load(cur_script)
            }
        }

        END {
            for(idx in script_names) {
                load(script_names[idx])
            }
        }

    We can go ahead and load one script every one hour:

        $ while :; do echo 1; sleep 1h; done | ./above_script.awk &gt; /tmp/events

    Now we have a bunch of timestamped events, but we'd like to frequently check
    memory usage too. Let's have another loop do that for us.

        $ while :; do echo $(date +%s) $(ps -q $(pgrep --exact weechat) -o rss,vsz | tail -n 1) &gt;&gt; /tmp/mem; sleep 5s; done

    Now to graph everything into a readable image we can use `gnuplot`:

        #!/bin/bash
        {
            cat &lt;&lt;EOF
            set term png small size 1900,600
            set output "/tmp/mem-graph.png"

            set ylabel "RSS (mb)"
            set y2label "VSZ (mb)"

            set ytics nomirror
            set y2tics nomirror in
            set grid ytics lc rgb "#bbbbbb" lw 1 lt 0

            set yrange [230.000:<em>]
            set y2range [90.000:</em>]

            set tic scale 0
            set xtics format " "
            set xtics rotate by 45 offset -0.8,-9.8
            set bmargin 11

        EOF
            cat /tmp/events | while read date ev_name; do
                echo "set arrow from $date, graph 0 to $date, graph 1 nohead"
                echo "set xtics add (\""$ev_name"\" $date)"
            done

            cat &lt;&lt;EOF
            plot "&lt; uniq -f 0 /tmp/mem" using 1:(\$3/1000) with lines axes x1y1 title "VSZ", \
                 "&lt; uniq -f 0 /tmp/mem" using 1:(\$2/1000) with lines axes x1y2 title "RSS"
        EOF
        } | gnuplot

    What's handy about this setup is that we can kill any script for any reason
    without losing data. In fact we can stop the first one and load whichever
    scripts we want, as long as we maintain `/tmp/events`.

    Of course you can run the `gnuplot` script on a remote box as long as you have
    access to the two logfiles.
