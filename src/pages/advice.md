Advice
=====

Better desk posture
------

* If you can't afford a split or ergonomic keyboard, use one keyboard per hand
  so that you may keep your back and chest straight and shoulders naturally
  apart. Keep your keyboard(s) close to the edge of the desk. Use the mouse
  sparingly.

* Imagine a string is pulling you upwards from your head. This should keep your
  chin relatively tucked in.

* Your shoulders should be hanging down: not shrugging. To do that raise your
  seat (pad it with whatever you have - blankets, pillows) and raise your
  monitors as well, by about a spread-palm-width using books or boxes. Its
  center should be right in front of you.

* Have your computer notify you every 1 hour. Get up and do some dynamic
  stretches, hop around, look out the window. Rest is paramount.

Time and distractions
------

* Know when your "work", "study", "hobbies" and "relaxation" sections of your
  day start and end. If you don't define them well enough, you will either reach
  catastrophic fatigue in a matter of a few days (overworking) or fall into
  limbo (understimulation).

* Write a distraction-free mode for your entire computer. In my case I can
  hide all notifications and irreversibly minimize all chat / mail windows
  with the press of two keys. Exiting this mode hints at all missed
  notifications, if any, and restores the windows.

* Use `/etc/hosts` to block things you don't need. Don't make it any easier to
  edit that file than it already is.

* If you catch yourself not having done anything useful while on the computer
  for a certain period of time, stop using it.

* People who sell used books have good suggestions for you. Balance work and
  literature books.

Buying things
------

* Amazon sells used products. Odd-colored products go for less.

* Don't forget to check the Amazon website of other countries and ebay as well.

* Buy yourself small things that will take a long time to arrive and may turn
  out to be engaging. It's a gift to your future self.

* Buy a cheap instrument. Ukulele, kalimba, flute, whatever.

* Before buying a piece of clothing, go online and click on everything
  relevant that you see. Pretend you're browsing those websites with the most
  stylish person you know and imagine what they would have to say. If there's
  any amount of "but" or "eh", it's not good.

Exercise, diet and hygiene
------

* Look up Antranik on YouTube for exercises you can do at home.

* Mathematically speaking, any amount of exercise is infinitely better than none and it's never too late to start.

* Finish your shower with cold water.

* Use a soft toothbrush. Pretend your teeth are ancient bones that you must carefully clean.

* Just eat a bit of everything and less of the bad stuff.
