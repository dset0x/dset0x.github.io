Advice
=====

Better desk posture
------

* If you can't afford a split or ergonomic keyboard, use one keyboard per hand
  so that you may keep your back and chest straight. Keep your keyboard(s)
  close to the edge of the desk. Use the mouse sparingly.

* Imagine a string is pulling you upwards from your head. This should keep your
  chin relatively tucked in.

* Your shoulders should be hanging down: not shrugging. To do that raise your
  seat (pad it with whatever you have - blankets, pillows) and raise your
  monitors as well, by about a spread-palm-width using books or boxes. Its
  center should be right in front of you. All yourself to rest too.

* Have your computer halt (eg. screen lock in `cron`) every 1 hour. Get up and do
  some dynamic stretches, walk around, look out the window.

Time and distractions
------

* Know when your "work", "study", "hobbies" and "relaxation" sections of your
  day start and end. If you don't define them well enough, you will reach
  catastrophic fatigue in a matter of a few days.

* Write a distraction-free mode for your entire computer. In my case I can
  hide all notifications and irreversibly minimize all chat / mail windows
  with the press of two keys. Exiting this mode hints at all missed
  notifications, if any, and restores the windows.

* Use /etc/hosts to block things you don't need. Don't make it any easier to
  edit that file than it already is.

* If you catch yourself not having done anything useful while on the computer
  for a certain period of time, stop using it, because you're not using it
  anyway.

* People who sell used books have good suggestions for you. Balance work and
  literature books.

Bad nights
------

* Hit suspend and go walk / skate / cycle. Prefer smaller streets. Do not return
  until the static in your head has gone away.

* If you go for a ride, always ride to ride another day.

* Find the nearest homeless person who sells that magazine and buy it.

* Listen to your favorite singer or artist. If you don't have one, find one.

Buying things
------

* Amazon sells used products. Girly-colored products go for less.

* Don't forget to check the Amazon website of other countries and ebay as well.

* Buy yourself cheap things that will take a long time to arrive. It's a gift
  from your past self - in the future.

* Buy a cheap instrument.

* Before buying a piece of clothing, go online and click on everything
  relevant that you see. Pretend you're browsing those websites with someone
  else and critique how sharp they look. If there's any amount of "but" or
  "eh", it's not good.

Cinema
------

* Don't go unless you've really been looking forward to the movie, or someone
  you are going with has.

Earphones
------

* Don't buy the around-the-ear type if you wear glasses.

* Don't wear them in public.

Exercise
------

* It's never too late. Look up Antranik on YouTube.

* Any amount helps.

Food
------

* Just eat a bit of everything and less of the bad stuff.

* Breakfast is not important.
