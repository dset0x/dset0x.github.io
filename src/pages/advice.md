## Better desk posture

* Imagine a string is pulling you upwards from your head. This should keep your
  chin relatively tucked in.

* Your shoulders should be hanging down: not shrugging. To do that raise your
  seat (pad it with whatever you have - blankets, pillows) and raise your
  monitors as well, by about a spread-palm-width using books or boxes. Its
  center should be right in front of you.

* Have your computer notify you about once an hour to get up and do some dynamic
  stretches, hop around, look out the window, do eye exercises.

* Learn how to stretch your back and shoulders:

## Time and distractions

* Know when your "work", "study", "hobbies" and "relaxation" sections of your
  day start and end. If you don't define them well enough, you will either reach
  catastrophic fatigue in a matter of a few days (overworking) or fall into
  limbo (understimulation). Rest is paramount.

* Write a distraction-free mode for your entire computer. In my case I can
  hide all notifications and irreversibly minimize all chat / mail windows
  with the press of two keys. Exiting this mode hints at all missed
  notifications, if any, and restores the windows.

* Use `/etc/hosts` or some other mechanism to block things you don't need.

* If you catch yourself not having done anything useful while on the computer
  for a certain period of time, stop using it.

* People who sell used books have good suggestions for you. Balance work and
  literature books.

## Buying things

* Amazon sells used products. Odd-colored products go for less. Ebay probably
  has equivalents for even less.

* Buy yourself small things that will take a long time to arrive and may turn
  out to be engaging. It's a gift to your future self. For example, a cheap
  instrument: An Ukulele, a kalimba or flute.

* Before buying a piece of clothing, go online and click on everything
  relevant that you see. Pretend you're browsing those websites with the most
  stylish person you know and imagine what they would have to say. If there's
  any amount of "but" or "eh", it's not good.

## Exercise, diet and hygiene

* Look up Antranik on YouTube for exercises you can do at home.

* Mathematically speaking, any amount of exercise is infinitely better than
  none and it's never too late to start.

* Finish your shower with cold water.

* Use a soft toothbrush. Pretend your teeth are ancient bones that you must
  carefully clean. Floss!

* Eat a bit of everything and less of the bad stuff.
