          <div class="preview">
              There&#39;s a number of window manager independant program launchers out there, but if you need to run arbitrary commands or want shell completion you might find yourself falling back to spawning a terminal every time. It&#39;s easy to create a `dmenu` replacement by adding this to your `~/.zshrc`: Entering this condition has a number of effects: It can do much more than what is available with other launchers: To run..

          <div class="preview">
              Vimperator has a commonly used &quot;hint&quot; mode where you may enter either a generated combination of characters or link&#39;s text to interact with that element. As you type characters in, vimperator filters out matching links for you. For example, if there&#39;s two links with the text &quot;About&quot; in them, typing in But what if you&#39;ve typed &quot;Abo&quot; and there&#39;s two &quot;About&quot; links (and nothing else containing &quot;abo&quot; in the page)..

              I sometimes find myself trying out different varations of a command until I manage get it to work the way I intended to. This involves a lot of jumping back and forth between words in my previous buffer. With a really simply function you can decrease the amount of jumping around the command line. Let&#39;s say you&#39;re working on the following command: Naturally, you keep getting the regexes wrong. Just..

              Edit: You should use `notmuch-addrlookup-c` instead as it has good support for `mutt` and executes much faster. Retrieving all known addresses from notmuch&#39;s index turned out to be more difficult than I had initially assumed. I needed to search not only recipients, but senders as well, due to mailing lists and such. Don&#39;t forget that mutt skips the first line of the addresses. This method is unfortunately quite slow, whether..

              Nesting while loops that match against the same string will throw perl into an infinite loop. Produces the following: That&#39;s right. Same pointer. You can work around this by using a copy of the string instead (or more likely, since you ran into this: `substr`)...

              mailto:// URLs are sometimes convenient to use, but they don&#39;t fit in too well with using a single mutt instance and having an aversion to windows popping up. One way to use them with mutt is to take advantage of the postponed feature. If your `postponed` variable points to a directory you may have multiple postponed messages. We can therefore generate a postponed message every time a mailto URI is..

              Reading HTML e-mail in the terminal can be a bit of a pain. `lynx` does a fine job at dumping them, but actually opening the URLs from it is cumbersome as they are placed at the very end of the message. Luckily, there&#39;s nothing a little bit of perl can&#39;t fix. Then put the following entry in your `~/.mailcap`: Now your spammy e-mail can look like this too!..

              Viber for Linux seems to work fine with apulse, except for taking the liberty of changing my system&#39;s volume to 100% shortly after starting. After no luck with trying to figure out if it was leveraging apulse itself to do this, I started believing it was calling alsa despite being a pulseaudio application: Unfortunately, this produces too much noise.
