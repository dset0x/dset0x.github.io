        <div class="preview">
            There&#39;s a number of window manager independant program launchers out there, but if you need to run arbitrary commands or want shell completion you might find yourself falling back to spawning a terminal every time. It&#39;s easy to create a `dmenu` replacement by adding this to your `~/.zshrc`: Entering this condition causes the shell (and controlling terminal) to exit after the first command, while taking care to store the command..

            I sometimes find myself trying out different varations of a command until I manage get it to work the way I intended to. This involves a lot of jumping back and forth between words in my previous buffer. With a really simply function you can decrease the amount of jumping around the command line. Let&#39;s say you&#39;re working on the following command: Naturally, you keep getting the regexes wrong. Just..

            Retrieving all known addresses from notmuch&#39;s index turned out to be more difficult than I had initially assumed. I needed to search not only recipients, but senders as well, due to mailing lists and such. Don&#39;t forget that mutt skips the first line of the addresses. This method is unfortunately quite slow, whether you use `parallel` or not. You are hitting the same database after all...

            Reading HTML e-mail in the terminal can be a bit of a pain. `lynx` does a fine job at dumping them, but actually opening the URLs from it is cumbersome as they are placed at the very end of the message. Luckily, there&#39;s nothing a little bit of perl can&#39;t fix. `~/.mutt/link-columns.pl`: Then put the following entry in your `~/.mailcap`: Now your spammy e-mail can look like this too!..

            mailto:// URLs are sometimes convenient to use, but they don&#39;t fit in too well with using a single mutt instance and having an aversion to windows popping up. One way to use them with mutt is to take advantage of the postponed feature. If your `postponed` variable points to a directory you may have multiple postponed messages. We can therefore generate a postponed message every time a mailto URI is..

            Viber for Linux seems to work fine with apulse, except for taking the liberty of changing my system&#39;s volume to 100% shortly after starting. After no luck with trying to figure out if it was leveraging apulse itself to do this, I started believing it was calling alsa despite being a pulseaudio application: Unfortunately, this produces too much noise. Looking at `/usr/include/alsa/mixer.h` it&#39;s easy to locate possibly used functions: In..

            I was recently dealing with a memory leak within a script in `weechat`. I needed a quick and dirty way of figuring out which script was causing the trouble. Of course it makes no sense to use `awk` for this, but what the heck. This script unloads all weechat scripts, then loads them one at a time whenever passed a line. We can go ahead and load one script every..
