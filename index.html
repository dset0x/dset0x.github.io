              You will notice that some of these applications (eg `mpd`) should only ever be ran once, while others are tied to the `X` session. For that, I use two supervision trees, one of which is executed in `~/.xinitrc` so that `$DISPLAY` is set. All I needed to get things running...

              Vimperator has a commonly used &quot;hint&quot; mode where you may enter either a generated combination of characters or link&#39;s text to interact with that element. As you type characters in, vimperator filters out matching links for you. For example, if there&#39;s two links with the text &quot;About&quot; in them, typing...

              Edit: You should use `notmuch-addrlookup-c` instead as it has good support for `mutt` and executes much faster. Retrieving all known addresses from notmuch&#39;s index turned out to be more difficult than I had initially assumed.

              mailto:// URLs are sometimes convenient to use, but they don&#39;t fit in too well with using a single mutt instance and having an aversion to windows popping up. One way to use them with mutt is to take advantage of the postponed feature. If your `postponed` variable points to a...

              Reading HTML e-mail in the terminal can be a bit of a pain. `lynx` does a fine job at dumping them, but actually opening the URLs from it is cumbersome as they are placed at the very end of the message. Luckily, there&#39;s nothing a little bit of perl can&#39;t...
